# User Stories Folder — Airbnb Clone

This folder contains the user stories I wrote based on the use case diagram from the last task. These stories describe how guests, hosts, and admins interact with the system and what they should be able to do.

## Files

- `user-stories.md` — The main file with all the user stories

## Why I wrote these

Writing user stories helps make it clear what features we need to build and why. It also helps when we plan out APIs, models, and permissions later in the backend.
