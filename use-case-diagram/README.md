# Use Case Diagram â€” Airbnb Clone

Hey ðŸ‘‹

This folder contains the use case diagram for the backend of the Airbnb Clone project. It shows how different users (actors) interact with the system for the main features like registering, booking properties and handling payments.

## ðŸ“„ File

- `airbnb_clone_use_case_diagram.png` â€” the use case diagram image I made with Draw.io

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s in the diagram

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the actors and what they can do:

- **Guest**
  - Register and log in
  - Search for property listings
  - Book properties
  - Make payments

- **Host**
  - Manage property listings
  - Manage bookings
  - Get payouts

- **Admin**
  - Manage users, listings, bookings, and payments from the admin dashboard

The "System" (backend API) handles all those actions in between.

## ðŸ¤“ Why this matters

I made this so itâ€™s clear who does what in the app â€” no guessing. It helps plan how we design our routes, models, and permissions later on.

## How to view

Just open the PNG file and zoom in if needed ðŸ™‚
